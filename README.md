# 1d_streamer

1D simulation of streamers using a fluid approach. The drift-diffusion equation is couple to the electro-static potential and electric field.

TO DO:
- Electric field calculation is not stable
- Check flux calculations after electric field fix
- Correctly write ion data out to output file
